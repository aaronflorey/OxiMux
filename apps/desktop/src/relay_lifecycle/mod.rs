//! The relay daemon's lifecycle once the app is running: the crash heartbeat,
//! respawn, and (later) the user-facing restart and kill-all.
//!
//! Boot (`main.rs`) brings the first daemon up and hands its client to
//! [`RelayLifecycle::install`]. From then on this module owns every daemon
//! replacement, so there is exactly one place that decides whether a death has
//! already been handled:
//!
//! - **Single flight.** Every replacement runs under `respawn_lock` and first
//!   checks that the session it is replacing is still the current one. A second
//!   caller for the same death finds the epoch moved on and returns
//!   [`RespawnOutcome::AlreadyRespawned`] without touching anything.
//! - **Owned deaths.** A manual restart records the session it is about to stop
//!   in `expected_death`, so the heartbeat that sees that pid vanish stays out of
//!   it — no crash copy, no throttle count, no second respawn.
//! - **A restart re-checks the epoch after taking the lock.** Aborting the
//!   heartbeat stops the watch, not a crash respawn it already spawned; that one
//!   may be parked on `respawn_lock` and win it. So a restart snapshots
//!   `current_session` before locking and, once it holds the lock, treats a
//!   moved epoch as "already replaced" instead of stopping the fresh daemon.
//! - **No `SHARED_BACKEND` lock on a runtime worker.** The main thread can hold
//!   that mutex inside a `block_on` whose reply needs this runtime; a parked
//!   worker would deadlock it. Stop, probe and kill-all therefore use the
//!   client held here, and the backend swap runs on the blocking pool.
//!
//! The UI reads the outcome from [`state::RelayDaemonState`], which one
//! foreground loop keeps current from the events this module emits.
