//! Replacing a daemon left over from another app version, at boot.
//!
//! Every update leaves the previous version's daemon running (same protocol,
//! same socket), so without this the new app keeps using old daemon code until
//! the user restarts it by hand. A stale daemon is replaced only when it has no
//! sessions: the daemon's own `Shutdown { kill_sessions: false }` refuses while
//! any are alive, in one step with the check, so a session started in between
//! is never killed. A stale daemon with sessions is kept and reported.
